Bleeding Edge Node for Windows x64
==================================

This is mostly just for easy access by my dev group, it's obviously not an official release and I have nothing to do with node etc.

You can download pre-built stable binaries for various operating systems from nodejs.org
[http://nodejs.org/download/](<http://nodejs.org/download/>).

You can download the source and build it yourself from the same
